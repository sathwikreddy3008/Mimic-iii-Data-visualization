# Mimic-iii-Data-visualization
Databricks Notebook for visual exploratory data analysis on a healthcare dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Includes univariate, bivariate, and correlation visualizations to extract insights from clinical data.

# Data Visualization on Healthcare Dataset

This project contains a Python Notebook that performs visual exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset. The goal is to uncover insights from patient-level data using various statistical plots and visual summaries.

## Key Features

- Import and clean structured clinical data
- Visualize univariate and multivariate distributions
- Analyze relationships between patient demographics and clinical outcomes
- Use advanced plots like violin plots, box plots, and heatmaps
- Identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in healthcare variables

## Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` – for static visualizations
- `seaborn` – for advanced statistical plotting
- `jupyter notebook` – for interactive development

## Visualization Topics Covered

- Gender and Age Distribution
- Count plots for categorical features
- Violin and box plots to show spread and outliers
- Heatmaps to explore correlations between numerical columns
- Distribution plots for continuous variables
